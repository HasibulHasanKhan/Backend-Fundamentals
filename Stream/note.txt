 * UseCase of Stream :

 - Efficient memory usage : Works with data in chunks.
 - Faster processing : Begins processing as soon as data arrives.
 - Non -Blocking: Streams use event-driven architecture.

 -------------------------------------------

 Readable : fs.createReadStream()
 Writeable : fs.createWriteStream()
 Duplex : net.Socket | Both readable and writeable.
 Transform : Similar to Duplex but modifies data(compression, encryption)
